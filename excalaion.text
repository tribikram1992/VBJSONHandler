Subject: Request for Role Reassignment and Leadership Opportunity for ModelN Project

Hi Raghavender,

I hope you're doing well.

I would like to formally bring to your attention several concerns I have observed in the current team dynamics across the ModelN and Snow Automation projects. These concerns are affecting transparency, morale, and the opportunity for fair contribution from all team members.

Key Observations:

1. Exclusion from Communication:
   I have been repeatedly left out of key communications related to the ModelN project, including updates and deliverables, despite being actively involved. This makes it difficult to collaborate effectively and undermines role clarity.

2. Lack of Credit Sharing:
   Documentation and work contributed by me and other team members are often forwarded to higher management without acknowledgment or including us in the communication. This misrepresents the true effort behind the deliverables and impacts team motivation.

3. Surface-Level Leadership Without Accountability:
   Nilesh frequently takes a lead role in meetings and communications but relies on team members (including myself) to complete the actual end-to-end work in the background. This gives a misleading picture of ownership and delivery responsibility.

4. Repeated Behavior in Snow Automation Project:
   This behavior is not limited to the ModelN project. We experienced a similar situation during the Snow Automation project, where contributions from team members were overshadowed and there was limited opportunity to directly showcase work. This created a demotivating and negative team environment.

5. Lack of Independent Ownership and Initiative:
   While Nilesh may be capable of handling automation and performance testing, it appears he is not inclined to take full ownership. Responsibilities are often delegated or informally shifted to others, which creates an unequal workload and slows down project momentum.

6. Suppressing Team Visibility and Growth:
   There is a consistent pattern of overshadowing team members and limiting their ability to present or take ownership of their work. This affects individual development and creates an unhealthy team culture.

My Request:

I am fully committed to the ModelN project and would like to formally request the opportunity to:

- Take complete ownership and leadership of the ModelN project including planning, stakeholder coordination, implementation, and quality assurance.
- Deliver the project on time and with zero defect leakage, while ensuring a transparent and fair contribution model for all team members.
- Have Nilesh reassigned to a different project, where his skills may be better aligned and this behavior pattern does not continue to hinder the progress and morale of others.

I believe this change will:
- Create a more accountable and balanced working environment.
- Improve project efficiency and visibility of individual contributions.
- Enable a culture of ownership, transparency, and mutual respect.

Thank you for taking the time to review this request. I am happy to discuss this further if needed.
